# Real-Time-Polling-App

URL :  https://real-time-polling-app.onrender.com 

This project is a real-time chat and polling application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.IO for real-time communication.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MongoDB (running locally or a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-polling-app.git
cd real-time-polling-app
2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
cd backend
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Start the backend server:

bash
npm start
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
cd ../client
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
npm start
The frontend application will run on http://localhost:3000.

Running the Application
Ensure MongoDB is running locally or you have a connection to MongoDB Atlas.

Start the backend server if not already running:

bash
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend server if not already running:

bash
cd client
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the application.

Technical Implementation and Challenges
Real-Time Communication:

Implemented using Socket.IO to facilitate real-time messaging and polling.
Established a WebSocket connection between the client and server for instant data exchange.
Authentication:

User registration and login are handled using JWT tokens.
Passwords are hashed using Bcrypt to ensure security.
Data Management:

Used Mongoose to define schemas and interact with MongoDB.
Chat messages and polls are stored in the database and retrieved in real-time.
Frontend Integration:

Used React for a dynamic and responsive UI.
Managed state with React hooks to handle real-time data updates.
Challenges:

Handling real-time updates efficiently without overloading the client or server.
Ensuring secure authentication and data transmission.
